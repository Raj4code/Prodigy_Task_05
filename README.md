# Prodigy_Task_05
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather,
and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Introduction:
Traffic accidents are a significant concern for public safety. By analyzing data related to these incidents,
we can identify patterns and contributing factors that might help in developing measures to reduce accidents. 
This project focuses on using traffic accident data to:
Identify accident hotspots.
Understand the impact of road conditions, weather, and time of day on accident frequency.
Visualize these patterns for better understanding and communication.

Visualization:
Key visualizations created in this project include:
Heatmaps: To show accident density across different regions.
Bar Charts: To compare accident frequency under different weather and road conditions.
Line Graphs: To analyze accident trends over time.


Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic statistics and visualizations to understand the data.
Pattern Identification: Analysis of how road conditions, weather, and time of day affect accident frequency.
Hotspot Visualization: Heatmaps and other visualizations to highlight accident hotspots.
Reporting: Generate reports summarizing the key findings.
